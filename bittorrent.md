# BitTorrent

All of Finnix's ISO releases are available via BitTorrent. You can find these links on [the main page](https://www.finnix.org/) for the most recent release. The current release is always served by multiple seeders, but older releases frequently have no seeds available.

Finnix torrents point to an IPv4-only primary tracker, and an IPv6-only secondary tracker. If you have IPv6, modern BitTorrent clients will utilize both trackers.

## Seeding

Once you are finished downloading via BitTorrent, please leave your client open for however long you can, to seed to other downloaders. Your contribution is appreciated.

If you would like to be a dedicated seeder, several BitTorrent clients support RSS feeds of torrents. Finnix publishes several feeds; the primary and recommended feed is:

* [seeder.rss](https://www.finnix.org/rss/bittorrent/seeder.rss) - Current Finnix releases

This feed contains the last two releases, as well as legacy release Finnix 109 in both x86 and PPC flavors.

Additionally, before Finnix releases are made, this feed will be updated with the unreleased version, usually at least a few days before release. This way, you automatically help build the seeds in preparation for a release, and you can get new Finnix releases before they are officially released!

Other feeds are available:

* [all-releases.rss](https://www.finnix.org/rss/bittorrent/all-releases.rss) - Every Finnix release ever made
* [current-release.rss](https://www.finnix.org/rss/bittorrent/current-release.rss) - Only the current release
* [current-release-x86.rss](https://www.finnix.org/rss/bittorrent/current-release-x86.rss) - Only the current release, x86
* [current-release-ppc.rss](https://www.finnix.org/rss/bittorrent/current-release-ppc.rss) - Only the current release, PPC (as PowerPC releases have been discontinued, this always serves Finnix-PPC 109)
